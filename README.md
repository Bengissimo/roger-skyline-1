Second system and network administration project of Hive Helsinki. With this project I configured a web server on a virtual machine from scratch, made it secure against possible attacks, created a login page and figured out a way for deployment automation.  

## VM set up
I set up a virtual machine with Debian Linux operating system with a disk size of 8 GB and a 4.2 GB partition.

## Network and security
### 1. Create a non-root user with sudo priviliges
``` 
$ su - 
# apt update -y && apt upgrade -y
# apt install sudo vim -y
# usermod -aG sudo <username>
# exit 
```

To check if the user in sudo group now:
```
$ groups
```
### 2. configure a static IP with a Netmask in \30
To be able to use the network, change the VM adapter setting to Bridged Adapter, en0: Ethernet.
Next, [configure a static IP.](https://wiki.debian.org/NetworkConfiguration#Configuring_the_interface_manually)
```
$ sudo vim /etc/network/interfaces
```
```
# The primary network interface
auto enp0s3
```
```
$ sudo vim /etc/network/interfaces.d/enp0s3
```
```
iface enp00s3 inet static
    address 10.11.249.86
    netmask 255.255.255.252
    gateway 10.11.254.254
```

Here I picked a random IP which does not belogn any computer in the cluster, and not used by anyone else (to check this I just used ping). With a Netmask \30 configuration the number of usable IP is two. I picked a network address 10.11.249.84 and set my IP to 10.11.200.86.

Restart networking service to update network interface and check the current state and verify internet connection:
```
$ sudo service networking restart
$ ip a
$ ping google.com
```

### 3. SSH configuration
Changing the default port 22:
```
$ sudo vim /etc/ssh/sshd_config
```
Uncomment #Port 22 and change 22 to another number. Prefer something between [49152 and 65535](http://www.steves-internet-guide.com/tcpip-ports-sockets/)

Configure publickey authentication:
Copyy the public key into ~/.ssh/authorized_keys file:
```
$ cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub | ssh remote_username@server_ip_address "mkdir -p ~/.ssh && chmod 700 ~/.ssh && cat >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys && chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys"
```
And update the sshd_config file accordingly:
- PermitRootLogin no
- PasswordAuthentication no
Restart ssh service and try connecting via ssh to see the new settings work properly.

### 4. Firewall configuration
I installed [Uncomplicated Firewall](https://wiki.debian.org/Uncomplicated%20Firewall%20%28ufw%29#Port_Ranges)
```
$ sudo apt install ufw
$ sudo ufw enable
$ sudo ufw default deny incoming
$ sudo ufw default allow outgoing
$ sudo ufw status verbose
$ sudo ufw allow <portnumber>/tcp
$ sudo ufw allow 443
$ sudo ufw allow 80/tcp
$ sudo ufw enable
$ sudo ufw status verbose
```

### 5. Fail2ban configuration to protect against denial of servicce attacks
First I installed [nginx].(https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-nginx-on-debian-10)

I chose to use [Fail2ban](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-fail2ban-works-to-protect-services-on-a-linux-server) service. Fail2ban basically monitors the logs of common services and spot patterns in failed attemps using specific filters. If there is a match, an action is executed for that service. For example blocks the IP if it exceeds the treshhold of max retry. Here is how I configured Fail2ban for:

```
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install fail2ban
```
To copy the contents of jail.conf with all contents, including the ones commented out:
```
$ awk '{ printf "# "; print; }' /etc/fail2ban/jail.conf | sudo tee /etc/fail2ban/jail.local
```
I did not change the default settings but changed [sshd] setting, did not change filter for sshd and added [http-get-dos]:
```
$ sudo vim /etc/fail2ban/jail.local

"
[sshd]
mode   = aggressive
enabled = true
port    = 49786
maxretry = 3
findtime = 300
bantime = 600
logpath = %(sshd_log)s
backend = %(sshd_backend)s

[http-get-dos]
enabled = true
port = http,https
filter = http-get-dos
logpath = /var/log/nginx/access.log
maxretry = 300
findtime = 300
bantime = 600
action = iptables[name=HTTP, port=http, protocol=tcp]
"

$ sudo vim /etc/fail2ban/filter.d/http-get-dos.conf

"
[Definition]

failregex = ^<HOST> -.*"(GET|POST).*

ignoreregex =
"
```
Activate jails and check info:
```
$ sudo service fail2ban restart
$ sudo fail2ban-client status
```
To test if Fail2ban configuration:
I used [slowloris](https://github.com/gkbrk/slowloris) for DoS attack and tried to connect via ssh from another computer lacking the ssh key.
In both of the cases attacking IPs were blocked successfully.
to confirm banned IPs, check this out:
```
sudo fail2ban-client status http-get-dos
sudo fail2ban-client status sshd
```
### 6. Protection against port scans
I installed [portsentry](https://en-wiki.ikoula.com/en/To_protect_against_the_scan_of_ports_with_portsentry)

```
$ sudo apt-get update && apt-get install portsentry
```
To use the portsentyr in advanced mode, following rules were changed:
```
$ sudo vim /etc/default/portsentry
```
```
TCP_MODE="atcp"
UDP_MODE="audp"
```
To ban the IP addresses attempting port scan:
```
$ sudo vim /etc/portsentry/portsentry.conf
```
```
BLOCK_UDP="1"
BLOCK_TCP="1"
```
```
# iptables support for Linux
KILL_ROUTE="/sbin/iptables -I INPUT -s $TARGET$ -j DROP"
```
To unban the IP, this command can be used and it is a good practice to check /etc/hosts.deny file to see/remove banned IPs:
```
iptables -D INPUT -s 178.170.xxx.xxx -j DROP
```
To test if portsentry protects against port scans, I used Nmap:
```
nmap <IP>
```
```
nmap -sT <IP>
```
### 7. Stopping the unnecessary services


### 8. A script to update packages
```
$ cd /usr/local/bin/
$ touch auto_update.sh
$ chmod 0755 auto_update.sh
$ vim auto_update.sh
```
```
#!/bin/bash

sudo apt-get update -y >> /var/log/update_script.log
sudo apt-get upgrade -y >> /var/log/update_script.log
```
Add to crontab:
```
$ sudo crontab -e
```
```
0 4 * * 0 /usr/local/bin/auto_update.sh
@reboot /usr/local/bin/auto_update.sh
```
### 9. A script to monitor changes in /etc/crontab file to notify root via local email service
monitor_crontab.sh script:
```
#!/bin/bash

DIFF=$(diff /etc/crontab.back /etc/crontab)
cat /etc/crontab > /etc/crontab.back
if [ "$DIFF" != "" ]; then
	echo "change detected in crontab, root will be notified" | mail -s "crontab modified" root
fi
```
To use the local mail system, I installed mailutils and postfix:
```
$ apt install mailutils postfix
```
For postfix settings, I chose local only and set system mail name to debian.lan. Then edited /etc/aliases:
```
root: root@debian.lan
```
to enable alias change:
```
$ sudo newaliases
```
## Web part
I did a pretty basic login page using html, php and css.
[Resource](https://www.php.net/manual/en/tutorial.forms.php)
I have three files for the login page
- index.html
- action.php
- styles.css

For self signed ssl certificate I followed [these instructions](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-create-a-self-signed-ssl-certificate-for-nginx-in-ubuntu-16-04)

## Deploymenyt part
I wrote a script for deployment which basicly move files through ssh nad update the old ones if there is a change.
